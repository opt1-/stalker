June 1, 2013
- added in magnet parsing
- automated transmission download

June 2, 2013
- Change code to use optparse
- Added optional Season Episode flag
* Added 720HD flag, if you prefer HD use this tag
- Cleaned up the code a bit

June 3, 2013
* removed 720HD flag for now

* change the structure of the code to allow an updated tvshow list

* rewrote the stalker_daemon and stalker_stalking function
 - made it parse the tvshows list to search for wanted

* made an stalker.log and error.log file
 - saves errors with timestamp
 - catches all exceptions during run time
 - writes what episodes are downloaded inside the stalker.log
 - fixed stalker.log to append information 'a+'

*** writing parseKing() - incomplete kept out of release
 - for now it opens a tvshow file in the format: show.name:s01:s02:s03e08
 - parses the information to make sure it does not download
 - previously downloaded files.
 - will-resave and iterate episode numbers when downloaded
 - to keep the tvshow list iteration automated


* wrote tvguide class
 - moved the log files and data there
 - passing tv class into stalker_stalking
 - will use it to update logs
 - block unwanted episode/season downloads
 - moved a few functions inside tvguide class, helps with interworking data
 - kept stalker_stalking() outside
 - fixed error logging

* write stalkerlog function in tvguide()
 - store name of file downloaded
 - store magnet link

* wrote shouldi to check for existing magnet downloads
 - this is how we check if a file has been downloaded so far.
 - want to change this in the future with a different filename
 - system in tvshows

June 4, 2013
 - when the main loop in stalker_main() returns from a thread
 - it closes the log file then sleeps
 - then reopens the log file 20 min later again
- this assists addshow.py to add tv shows to the file to avoid bugs

* changed readytowatch to use the tvshow variable passed in
 - this avoids a bug where another thread could change the value
 - from the main loop

* rewriting parseKing()
 - takes the tv show entry in the full format
 - controls most of the program

* wrote shouldi()
 - checks if file has been downloaded before (from magnet.log)

* wrote download()
 - just executes the download sequence

* wrote magcheck()
 - parses the tvshows file for existing download (including episodes)

* fixed guidesetup()
 - found out .strip goes before .split and it can concat both string commands
 - added a parse to skip # commented out entries in the file

* moved some code around
- mainly from the old magnetmagic() was turned into download()
 - moved the string code into stalker_stalking directly
  - it now passes on a finished mag link as return
  - back to parseKing()
  - which sets off on it's epic quest to hunt log files for exisiting downloads.
  - if they don't exist, and are not blocked it will proceed to download.

* writing updatetvshow()
 - open tvshows file
 - index the file vs tvshows which should contain the same output
 - find a way to 
 - HAVE to find a way to increment an episode that has been downloaded

June 6, 2013
* forgot what i wrote, it was late, was hungover.

June 7, 2013
* Wrote stalker_creeping
 -ability to parse rss search for ezrss.it
 - will find torrent links, and return the torrent link to parseKing

* wrote getepisode()
 - regex search to find the episode inside of a link
 - returns episode

* wrote updatetvshow()
 - opens tvshows, parses lines, rewrites any line containing tvshow name
 - and appends the new episode to it

* re-wrote most of the program from scratch, it was too much work to keep track of changelogs.

June 09, 2013
* deleted updatetvshow(), changed stalker_creeping
* updated a bunch of functions
* changed the structure of all of the code, the way it runs, and how it is organized
 - this was important to end up with lists coming out of the main process
 - now they can be manipulated.

* fixed the tv.downloads list, it now parses data properly, getting a giant list of links
* fixed writing output to a new tvshows file

* skips 720p episode for now (will incorporate this in the future

* fixed the append and save the list of shows that are being downloaded
* fixed the downloading to not download duplicates
* fixed the TPB search function - currently takes links from the first page with the most seeders list "0/7/0" page two would be "1/7/0" in the url. FYI future note.
